     * This execute() method is intended to be exposed to the user.
     * In a typical implementation, this method will be called 128
	 * times (or the maximum number of simultaneously existent
	 * Commands) during each update. Even if a Command is not in
	 * use or has not been defined this method will still be
     * invoked on a key during the update loop. This static
	 * version of execute() is responsible for determining
	 * whether or not a Command has actually been triggered
	 * and, in such a case, invoking its corresponding
     * user-defined execute() method. There are 2 primary styles by
	 * which a Command can be triggered by an InputDevice:
	 * CONTINUOUS and via a TOGGLE. The simpler of the 2,
	 * CONTINUOUS, simply works by setting a Command's _On
	 * field to true or false depending on the last recorded
	 * state of that Command's corresponding key or button trigger.
	 * 1 means a key press is in progress while 0 indicates a
	 * release. CONTINUOUS Commands maintain a direct relationship
	 * with their representative elements' values in the
     * structures backing the devices to which they're bound.
     * TOGGLE Commands, however, are slightly more complex. Key
	 * strikes are progressively logged (up to the most recent
     * 64 button states) in the form of an 8-byte bit string
	 * (this is happening regardless of _Style), the 62 most
     * significant bits serving no integral purpose (although, I'm
	 * sure one could find something cool to use them for; who
	 * knows, maybe analogu e emulation is possible this way...).
	 * What we're really concerned with are the 2 least
	 * significant bits (rightmost and most recent states). The
	 * abridged explanation is as follows: 00, 01, and 11 do
	 * NOT trigger a state change, while a 10 does, meaning a
	 * Command will be toggled to its opposite state ONLY at
	 * the instant its key or button has been released.
     * 
     * @param key contents of an array element represented by a
     * physical key or button; note that this argument is NOT
     * the actual physical key that's been pressed, but the
     * state and command index information in the array element
     * representing the physical key's status. See InputDevice.get().
